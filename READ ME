# Movie Rating Predictor

## Overview
This project predicts IMDb movie ratings using a **Random Forest Regressor** based on attributes like genre, director success rate, and movie duration.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of Indian movies with details such as **Year, Duration, Genre, Director, and IMDb Ratings**.
- It includes missing values that are handled through **imputation techniques**.
- Categorical features like **Genre and Director** are encoded for better model performance.

## Installation
To run this project locally, clone this repository and install dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Model
Run the following command to execute the model:
```sh
python src/main.py
```
Alternatively, you can run the notebook in **Google Colab** by opening `Movie_Rating_Predictor.ipynb`.

## Feature Engineering
- **Director Success Rate**: Calculated as the average rating of previous movies directed by the same director.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Applied to the `Genre` column to convert categorical values into numerical form.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Median and mode imputation are used where necessary.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to measure its prediction accuracy.
